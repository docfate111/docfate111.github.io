# Meaning

These artworks represent the cyclical nature of life and death. The first has caterpillars, chrysalis, and butterflies and then the skull to represent death. 
Of all the layers only the butterflies have color to show how they are in a stage focused on the most. For the background black and white worked since the caterpillars and butterflies were all too colorful. As a result, for the caterpillars I muted them to black and white to make their texture stand out and the butterflies I changed the color of to make their colors stand out and create a more somber tone. 
I then also did the same with frogs and tadpoles, ladybugs and their larvae, as well as flowers. The images individually do not have any meaning but together they represent life.
