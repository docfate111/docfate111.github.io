 * [Minimax1](https://docfate111.github.io/chess/minimax/index.html): lookahead for 1 move (can't do multiple due to algorithmic complexity)
 Instead it just tries to get the most points
 Still way to slow keep trying to optimize it
 The first few moves are taken from most done moves in the Lichess kaggle data set
